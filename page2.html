<h1>About the Learning Journeys</h1>
<p>I went to the Natural History Museum.</p>
<img src="Natural History Museum.jpg"/>
<p>There were many exhibitions and specimens about unique animal that could be rarely seen.There was also fossils of animals that have been extinct long ago.The museum specialises in Biology and has a lot of informations on animals and other living things.</p>
<p>There is even a facilitator to introduce us the different species of living things there and tell us more about the living things that we find unique.</p>
<p>I learnt a lot about Biology and how it is like as well as how it works in real life.I also learn how to classify at a higher level.</p>
